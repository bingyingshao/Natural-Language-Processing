### Project 1: Text Pre-processing
The project task is to write a program that accepts as input a plain text document and extract some properties of the content.

### Project 2: Language Models
The project task is to implement unigram and bigram language models from scratch. 
Specifics: Create models from a given (training) data and run them on a test data to evaluate the models.

### Project 3: HMM-Viterbi Algorithm for POS tagging
The project task is to implement an HMM-based approach to POS tagging from scratch. Specifically, implement the Viterbi decoding algorithm, as described in J&M section 10.4, using a bigram tag/state model.
